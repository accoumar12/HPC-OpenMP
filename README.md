# HPC-OpenMP

This work was done during the High Performance Computing (HPC) course at ISAE-SUPAERO.
The task was to apply parallelization using OpenMP on an image compression problem, in order to greatly increase the performance of the K-means compression algorithm.

For example, these are the results of a 8-colour compression:
